=============

**Make sure to conform all code to the [Official Style Guide for Python](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)**

=======
Do we want a couple of readme's:

• urgent issues (use issues method for this, I'm assuming)
• task assignments, updates, misc issues & questions
• ideas for consideration or later development

###----NOTES FROM JONATHAN----

We should probably have a game time to play some different games and see what we all like.
