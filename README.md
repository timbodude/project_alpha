ideas:
As we differentiate units, consider a Scout-type attack unit which can move or hide concealed with instructions to take action upon contact, to follow, to attack, to report a concealed enemy or troop movement.... It's movement rate can be adjusted by it's skill level, and other units could have a skill that gives them the possibility of detecting concealed opponents.
