project_alpha
=============

Do we want a couple of readme's:

• urgent issues (use issues method for this, I'm assuming)
• task assignments, updates, misc issues & questions
• ideas for consideration or later development

Upoaded old files to repository - not sure we want them there, but wanted to pass them on to Travis. The place to start is notes. While there may be some code we can grab, I'm thinking it may be better to start fresh so we're completely on the same page.

Looks like the github windows gui requires windows7. I'm on xp 5.1 service pack 3. I am using a less powerful gui that seems to be working, and has a dos prompt.

By the way, Travis - I'm using Wang as my ide and pygame to deal with gui issues like frames and such

#---Skill INFO/IDEAS---

These are mostly all for latter use but I wanted to get the ball rolling.

For skills I am thinking along the lines of stealing a bit from Dwarf Fortress and D&D since
they pretty much got everything right already and follow a more realistic design.
