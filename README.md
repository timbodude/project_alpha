project_alpha
=============

Do we want a couple of readme's:

• urgent issues (use issues method for this, I'm assuming)
• task assignments, updates, misc issues & questions
• ideas for consideration or later development

Still trying to figure out how to stage files (and where)

Looks like github requires windows7 to allow me to use the windows desktop interface. I'm on xp 5.1 service pack 3

By the way, Travis - I'm using Wing as my ide and pygame to deal with gui issues like frames and such
