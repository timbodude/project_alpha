=============

**Make sure to conform all code to the [Official Style Guide for Python](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)**

=======
Do we want a couple of readme's:

• urgent issues (use issues method for this, I'm assuming)
• task assignments, updates, misc issues & questions
• ideas for consideration or later development


**[Travis: game-grid was getting huge so I moved it to design_inspirations.md]**

###---Story Ideas (feel free to add)---
Nameless person from some town 
your sheep have been killed by killer rabits that appered out of nowere.
you have to go find the monster resposible for unleashing these rabbits.

###---Skill INFO/IDEAS---

These are mostly all for latter use but I wanted to get the ball rolling.

For skills I am thinking along the lines of stealing a bit from Dwarf Fortress and D&D since
they pretty much got everything right already and follow a more realistic design.

Speach
Language
Perseption
Common Sense
Kinesthetic Sense
Intuition
Intimidate
Willpower
Focus
Analytical Ability

**(probably should move these to github->Issues)**
###---Dad is working on---
combat windows:
Possible Pre-Combat Order:
• Create battle map
• Position enemy units - if in LOS, reveal
• Select unit types (if more than one type)
• Position Units
• Give units initial command series (like cards in a card game)
• Begin Turn order

Possible Turn Order:
• Verify unit is alive
• Verify unit is not stunned/stuck/disabled/hidden or timed command
• Verify unit is not in melee (if in melee and moves away, penalty or opponent attack applies)
• Move towards target area (question - how far move each turn?)
  - determine next square
  - if legal, move into square
  - verify if unit becomes engaged in melee
  - if remaining movement, move again until no more remaining movements
• Determine combat
• Get user command
  - change unit's target or list of targets (location or unit)
  - change attack type or whatever other options are offered

Initial Unit types:
• warrior type class (start with this one for all units including player)
• ranged type class
• support type class
• player unit (it's own class, or one of the others?)
• stealth unit
