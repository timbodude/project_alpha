**Civilization:** world conquest & match civ development w player style  | **World of Warcraft Vanilla to Cata:** Vanilla - Wrath had epic world feel, Cata had awesome gameplay | **Zelda: Ocarina of Time:** Something fun happens every ~15 mins, character progression, dungeon layout |   
**WOW Burning Crusade:** beyond anything out there at the time | **Heroes of Newerth:** The best pvp of the MOBA genera out there in my opinion | **Dwarf Fortress:** depth of experience, easy to create interesting stories |
**The Legend of Zelda:** early days! fun to explore, but beatable  |  **Total War Rome:** Amazing depth of stratagy and still interesting... even after 150+ hours... | **Batman: Arkham Asylum:** fluid combat, something fun happens every ~15 mins, player connection with characters | 
**oregon trail:** really early days, but customizable and personalized | **Hearthstone:** Simple but so complex at the same time, ever changing challenges | **The Binding of Isaac:** Subject Material, replay value/variability, short play sessions | 
**Delta Force:** my fav multiplayer shooter | **UFO:** As close to perfect as I can imagine a turn based strategy can get | **Dead Space 2:** Setting/mood, weapons (effect on environment) |
